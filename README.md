# csharp-basics

## Overview

This repository contains a set of walkthroughs about C# programming.  They are meant for beginners with no programming experience.  The walkthroughs are done in Visual Studio 2010, but any later version of Visual Studio will also work.

## Contents

1. **Getting Started With .NET** - Get familiar with the Visual Studio environment, the designer, and the code-behind.  Create a basic project that displays a "hello world" message when a button is clicked.

2. **Variables** - Learn how to store and retrieve values.  Create a project that multiplies two numbers and displays the result.

3. **If Statements and For Loops** - Learn how to control program flow by conditionally executing code, and running the same commands multiple times.  Create a project that prints out all numbers from 1 to the specified number.

4. **Methods** - Learn how to group code into resuable blocks.  Create a project that encrypts and decrypts a message.

5. **Recursion** - Learn how to simplify problems until you reach a base case.  This makes seemingly difficult problems easy to solve!  Create a project that checks if a string is a palindrome.

6. **Classes** - Learn how to model custom data and create instances of it.  Create a project that displays information about different Pokemon.

7. **Data Structures** - Learn about arrays, matrices, and lists.  Create a project that displays pictures of cats, a multiplication table, and the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
